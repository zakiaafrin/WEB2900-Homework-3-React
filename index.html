        Question-1 : What lessons did you learn doing the project?
        <hr />
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b
          >Answer : React is very interesting library to me. By doing this
          project, I have learned a lot such that how to create new component
          which can be reusable to where I need, how to fetch data from the API
          and display in server by deploying, how to create router component.

        Question-2 : What would you do differently?
        <hr />
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b
          >Answer : I have used React moment to parse and format dates and React
          clock to display local time. And I also use some funny weather image
          to entertain other users.</b

        Question-3 : How the skills you learned can be applied elsewhere?
        <hr />
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b
          >Answer : I think I can create any new thing/project using React
          Library. Because I have learned many things with the help of our
          professor and watching some really great videos which are really very
          helpful within a very short time period.</b

      <h3>
        Question-4 : What was the hardest and easiest part of the project?
        <hr />
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b
          >Answer : The hardest part was to start the project because that time
          I didn't know about React. After studying on React I tried to do part
          by part to create the project. I have tried very hard and spent more
          time to finish the work and I am successful now. The easiest part was
          using map function to get the data from the weather API.</b
